# RiddleFX
 A simple project using JavaFX and JDBC

 I developed this project as an exercise to study my final exam.

 Since I couldn't find a way to include database in the jar file, you need to put the database file to the target directory from the resources. So for shortcut, I include the executable-jar and database file in the project.
